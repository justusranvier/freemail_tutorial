	<h1>Home</h1>
	<p>This is the official site for Freemail - e-mail over Freenet. Freemail can be used to communicate annoymously and therefore freely on Freenet.</p>
	<p>Freemail is a Freenet node plugin which uses the Web of Trust pluging to create mail identities. It is based on the original Freemail created by Dave Baker and Alexander Lehmann.</p>
	<p>Freemail 0.2 introduced the new identity management based on WoT as well as the new web interface that includes a simple webmail client. Due to the change in identity management this version is not compatible with earlier versions and uses a new address format as well as a new default directory.</p>

			<h3>Tuesday, 10th July, 2012</h3><p>Freemail 0.2.2-rc1 is released</p><h4>Release notes:</h4>
			<code>
			<p>I said I was going to release 0.2.2 today, but found an important bug at the last minute, so we'll call it RC1 instead and delay 0.2.2 for a day or two. The two most important fixes are both related to privacy. The first one fixes a bug in the webmail client that would make the date be sent in the local language instead of English, and the second fixes the filtering of messages from email clients which would send the local timezone instead of converting it to UTC. Both bugs were as far as I can tell introduced in 0.2. Because of this I would very much appreciate an email (via the webmail client) from someone that has their computer configured for something other than English.</p>
